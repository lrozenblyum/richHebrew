richHebrew.js
==========

Make it easier to write Hebrew in HTML and style it.

The motivation to develop this framework: 
I'd like to have possibility to style niqqud in different way than the letter, e.g. nikkud under letter should have different colour.

It's not easy to do in cross-browser way:
